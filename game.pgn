definitely defensible}) 11. Bxd5 $1 {[pgndiagram] A very counterintuitive
exchange. You can feel the understanding Steinitz had for the game from moves
like these. His games are full of deep strategic ideas.} Bxd5 {The right

unpleasant, he should be able to unravel his forces and fight for the draw})
